# DragonNestClientless
Client-network emulator for DragonNest MMORPG. C#.

The kingpin of botting - the clientless bot. 

No game client required - simply a lightweight GUI that sends and recieves packets. Can be used to perform automated tasks in Villages, DDOS attacks (as you can run hundreds of these clients), blah blah.

Should be used with DragonCrypto unless you port XTEA Crypto to c# (quite easy and alot more convenient than updating a DLL each patch/keychange)

This one took alot of work. Old project nevertheless.
